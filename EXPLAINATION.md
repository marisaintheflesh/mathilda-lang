# What is this repository even?!

I have envisioned a self-made, homegrown 2.5d game engine for a very long time (well over 15 years). At this point, it's safe to say its vapourware. ADHD, ya know?!

One winter night very early in the morning, I was very distressed and wandering the streets, freezing cold beyond comprehension, when an idea come to me. A lot of game engines have a built-in scripting language, but will often design them to be restrictive for security reasons. What if my in-game scripting language didn't restrict anything beyond what the computer's operating system restricted? What if it was a fully functional and operational programming language within the game?

The first idea I had of how this might be used in practice was using the scripting language to download JSON from a web API that contained a randomly selected picture, then parsed the JSON, downloaded the picture itself and set an in-game wall texture to this randomized picture. Each time it'd be a different picture on this wall. You could make a virtual "art gallery" in a video game full of randomized pictures.

It would be chaos, an absolute disaster in the making, and that's what intrigued and interested me.

I gave it the name *Math*ilda, inspired by both the character Matilda from the movie of the same name and the character Matilda from the movie "The Professional".

I envisioned Mathilda as a cross between the syntax of C++ and the simplicity and ease of use of Python.

Mathilda the scripting language is also vapourware, I'll openly admit, but the vision lives on! Don't let the flame die out! ðŸ˜Š
